# Welcome to the **Lab-ni-Maam** repository!

This repository is dedicated to storing all of my laboratory exercises from Ma'am's class. Each folder represents a different lab session, containing the corresponding Java programs and activities assigned during the course.

## Repository Structure

- **Laboratory 1**: Contains the Java programs and exercises from the first lab session.
- **Laboratory 2**: Contains the Java programs and exercises from the second lab session.
  
Additional labs will be added as the course progresses.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of my work throughout the course, allowing me to track my progress and revisit previous exercises as needed.
